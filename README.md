## OverView
### Process
Liam made the repo, because the github classroom ran out of avaible ones. He then added everyone else as a collaborator. He then created the project itself, added everyone as an Admin, and then made that public. From there we decided as a group that we are creating a portfolio website for the "owner" that displays information for that person. After we decided on our Epic concept, Noah made the Epic calling it "Epic" and then created a second feild called "Story Points". Within the Project Liam also created a To-do, IceBox, in progress, and done section. We all then created several User Storyboards that develop further the different features of this portfolio website. On each user storyboard, there is an assigning to a specific team member and a description that begins with "As a User...". We then went through each user story board and assigned correlating story points on each. We discussed this thouroughly to make sure that each one was ranked in a way that we all agreed upon. After this, we added user acceptence criteria.
